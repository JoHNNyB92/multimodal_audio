00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,092
'cause this is
something I heard.

00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,794
I don't know if it's true
and tell me if it's rude

00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,563
or offensive, but:
Your name is not Travis Scott.

00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,598

-How did you?
Where's? Where does?

00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,144
Usually, if you think

00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,812
it's just, I don't know.
It's not Travis Scott.

-Yeah.

00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:51,150
-I mean, now, it means
something, but, I mean,

00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,618
how did you pick Travis Scott?

00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:54,454
My uncle was named Travis

00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,357
and Kid Cudi is like one of my
favorite artists of all time

00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,728
and his real name is
Scott Mescudi.

00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,729
And my uncle's friends
call him Scott, too,

00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,431
so it kinda like
worked out like that.

00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:08,801

superheroes, you know.

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,679
That's it again.

00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,515
Tomorrow night, you're gonna be
the musical guest on "SNL."

00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,317
Do you get nervous
for that type of jam?

00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,685
-Uh...

00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,640
How does he work his... Why are his shoulders
so strong looking? Because they're very defined

00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,470
for a man. How does he do that? I should do
that.

00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:14,060
What? Do I have incredibly defined shoulders?
I always think they're quite rounded. I'll

00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,860
take it.

00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,300
He was doing this. I think he thinks they're
quite stacked.

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,480
Honestly, I don't know where that's come from.
But thanks Max for that.

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,440
Yeah, I don't...

00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:37,020
I go to the gym, I guess. I swim a lot, which
I think won't harm me. Yeah, I don't know.

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,780
I was born with this. This is my mum and dad's
genes. My mum has incredibly large shoulders.

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,240
And my question for Doug?

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,140
What's his morning routine? Like when he wakes
up in the morning, what's the first thing

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,589
he does and the last thing he does? You know,
before he has to leave the house.

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:02,530
I'd be intrigued to know. He must use some
sort of incredible moisturiser. But you know,

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,390
he always looks flawless.

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,160
Thanks Sam. What is my morning routine? Sort
of pull myself out of bed, jump in the shower,

00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,300
have a bowl of cereal, run out the door - normally
ten minutes late. That's my routine.

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:26,159
How did they survive working with ten overly
excited boys for two months and survive and

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,220
come out of it still liking us? I think that's
quite a good question. How did they possibly

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,960
do that?

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,300
-We didn't.
-No.

00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,200
Why do you think we're doing the interviews
together and not with the boys?

00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,140
They're in a different hotel.

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,709
We won't even be near them.

00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,720
Because they're all just so lovely and funny.

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,380
Yeah.

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,820
And I still feel like I like them a little
bit, even when I watch the film actually.

00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:57,220
Yeah, I think... Because you know sort of
like all of those moments, and then you stop,

00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:03,260
and they're just silly and ridiculous and
lovely. So I find it's quite hard to separate that.

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,000
There was a moment actually in the scene when
all the boys are like... When it gets far

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,910
too close to sexual abuse with Lauren. There
was a moment when Doug put his hand on me

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,830
in between takes, and went are you alright,
Holly? And I was um...

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,090
Actually don't.

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,180
In a bit.

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,960
In a bit, in a bit.

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,220
When we're off set.

Hi Sri. Thanks for taking a few minutes to talk to us today.

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When you're talking to your customers, what's top of mind for them these days?

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
5G is top of mind. 5G is now.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
5G is front and center, compared to a year ago.

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
5G, what does it mean, in terms of network architecture?

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What the business models are?

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What kind of applications will be enabled thanks to 5G?

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Is it AR, VR, is it gaming? Is it massive sensors?

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All of those are things that our customers are looking at.

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And how has the landscape changed in the past year?

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Security is something that is

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
significantly more important compared to even a year ago.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You see a lot of news articles, whether it is Facebook privacy issues

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or some of the DDoS attacks.

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So customers are worried about how to make their networks more robust,

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
more security proof.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Just doing perimeter security is not enough.

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Firewalls are not enough.

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And they're looking to see how to protect

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
bad actors from within the network.

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So that's front and center.

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Have you seen any change in the adoption of 5G by our customers?

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They're all getting ready to deploy.

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
More in pockets of the world.

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Definitely in the U.S. And the two Olympic countries, in Korea and in Japan.

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And also in some parts of the world where big cities,

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
take London, Northern Dubai,

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you see quite a few places where there is very active planning going on.

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And some of our customers are also

00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
very serious about being first to market,

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
it's significant from a marketing perspective.

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And so, we do expect to see deployments happen by the end of the year.

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Also remember 5G is not just radio. It's also the entire network

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to enable some of the applications that are coming on with 5G,

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the need to think of the network end to end.

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now, we introduced the FP4 silicon last year and several FP4-based products,

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and customers are in trial with those now.

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What kind of feedback are you getting on those?

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Exceptional! We publicly announced that we have over 60 trials on FP4.

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Every single trial that we've done so far has gone exceptionally well.

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There is very heavy demand for our products to be shipped,

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
for products to continue expanding the trials that we have.

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And they are excited about the features that we are enabling,

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
effectively, flexibility without any compromises.

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And so we couldn't be more proud and excited about our FP4 launch.

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Nice. Well thanks for taking a few minutes to talk to us today.

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Sure. Thank you. 
Thanks.
